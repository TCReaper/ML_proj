    <b>50.007 ML Design Project - Group 9</b>
</p>

Our primary objective in this project is to develop a robust sequence labeling model tailored for informal texts,  
utilizing the foundational concept of the hidden Markov model (HMM) discussed in class. 

## Getting Started
### 1. Installation
- Download Python - <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
- Install Jupyter Notebook
```bash
pip install notebook
```
- Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TCReaper/ML_proj/
```


### 2. Code Files
All of the code is executable from `main.ipynb`.  
However, we have split the multiple questions into separate files for readability:
```bash
main.ipynb
ML_Proj_Part_1.ipynb
ML_Proj_Part_2.ipynb
ML_Proj_Part_3.ipynb
ML_Proj_Part_4.ipynb
```


### 3. Running
You can run the Python Notebook files that represent each part of the project individually.  
Run all cells for each Python Notebook file to obtain the results as specified in our report.

### 4. Report
We have also included the report in this GitHub as `ML_Final_Report_Group_9.pdf`
